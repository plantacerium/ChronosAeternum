# ChronosAeternum
Chronos Aeternum Plantacerium is a sacred horological instrument designed to transform the ephemeral passage of time into a permanent inventory of human experience. Drawing inspiration from celestial mechanics and high-jewelry precision, it provides a meditative interface for anchoring your consciousness in the void.
